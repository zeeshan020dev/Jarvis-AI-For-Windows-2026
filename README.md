# 🤖 Jarvis AI for Windows

A **voice-controlled personal AI assistant for Windows**, inspired by *JARVIS*, built using **Python**, **Google Gemini AI**, **Speech Recognition**, and **Text-to-Speech**.

Jarvis can:
- 🎙️ Listen to voice commands
- 🧠 Respond intelligently using **Google Gemini**
- 🔊 Speak responses aloud
- 🌐 Open websites
- 🎵 Play local music
- 📁 Open folders
- 📝 Save AI-generated responses
- ⏰ Tell the current time

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Before running Jarvis, ensure you have:

* ✅ Python 3.9 or above
* ✅ A working microphone
* ✅ Internet connection
* ✅ Google Gemini API Key

---

## 🔐 Getting Google Gemini API Key (Step-by-Step)

1. Go to **Google AI Studio**
   👉 [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)

2. Sign in with your Google account

3. Click **“Get API Key”**

4. Create a new API key

5. Copy the key

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 google-genai pyaudio
```

> ⚠️ If PyAudio fails on Windows, install using precompiled wheels:
> [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio)

---

### 2️⃣ Create `config.py`

```python
apikey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

⚠️ **Never commit your API key to GitHub**

---

## ▶️ Running Jarvis

```bash
python main.py
```

You should hear:

> **“Jarvis AI Activated”**

## 🧠 How AI Works

* Uses **Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`)**
* Maintains conversation context using `chatStr`
* Responses are spoken using **Text-to-Speech**
* Long AI responses are saved in the `Openai/` folder

---

## 🔊 Fix: Jarvis Not Speaking?

Ensure:

* ✔️ `pyttsx3` installed correctly
* ✔️ System audio output is enabled
* ✔️ Windows speech engine is available

Test voice separately:

```python
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("Testing Jarvis voice")
engine.runAndWait()
```

---

## 🐞 Common Errors & Fixes

### ❌ Microphone Timeout Error

```
speech_recognition.exceptions.WaitTimeoutError
```

✔️ Speak clearly
✔️ Ensure microphone access enabled
✔️ Reduce background noise

---

### ❌ API Quota Exhausted

Jarvis automatically:

* Detects `429` errors
* Waits before retrying
* Announces the issue via voice

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

* ❌ Do NOT hardcode API keys
* ✔️ Use `config.py` or environment variables
* ✔️ Add `config.py` to `.gitignore`

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 Wake word detection
* 🌐 Offline mode
* 📱 Mobile integration
* 🧠 Memory persistence
* 🎯 Custom command training
